# WeatherChallenge
a simple weather app 

## Weather API
I have chosed WeatherAPI as a service, the main reason for this, is that it has autocomplete API for searching for city names.

## Features
- Clean Archeticture 
- MVVM design pattern
- Combine
- Repositories
- Unit testing
- UI testing

## Libraries
The project doesn't contain any 3rd party library, I think it's cleaner to use the native components


## Xcode
project built using xcode 13.1 and support ios 13+
